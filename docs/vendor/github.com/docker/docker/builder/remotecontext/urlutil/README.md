# urlutil

```go
import "github.com/docker/docker/builder/remotecontext/urlutil"
```

Package urlutil provides helper function to check if a given build\-context location should be considered a URL or a remote Git repository.

This package is specifically written for use with docker build contexts, and should not be used as a general\-purpose utility.

## func IsGitURL

```go
func IsGitURL(str string) bool
```

IsGitURL returns true if the provided str is a remote git repository "URL".

This function only performs a rudimentary check \(no validation is performed to ensure the URL is well\-formed\), and is written specifically for use with docker build, with some logic for backward compatibility with older versions of docker: do not use this function as a general\-purpose utility.

The following patterns are considered to be a Git URL:

```
- https://(.*).git(?:#.+)?$  git repository URL with optional fragment, as known to be used by GitHub and GitLab.
- http://(.*).git(?:#.+)?$   same, but non-TLS
- git://(.*)                 URLs using git:// scheme
- git@(.*)
- github.com/                see description below
```

The github.com/ prefix is a special case used to treat context\-paths starting with "github.com/" as a git URL if the given path does not exist locally. The "github.com/" prefix is kept for backward compatibility, and is a legacy feature.

Going forward, no additional prefixes should be added, and users should be encouraged to use explicit URLs \(https://github.com/user/repo.git\) instead.

Note that IsGitURL does not check if "github.com/" prefixes exist as a local path. Code using this function should check if the path exists locally before using it as a URL.

\# Fragments

Git URLs accept context configuration in their fragment section, separated by a colon \(\`:\`\). The first part represents the reference to check out, and can be either a branch, a tag, or a remote reference. The second part represents a subdirectory inside the repository to use as the build context.

For example,the following URL uses a directory named "docker" in the branch "container" in the https://github.com/myorg/my-repo.git repository:

https://github.com/myorg/my-repo.git#container:docker

The following table represents all the valid suffixes with their build contexts:

| Build Syntax Suffix            | Git reference used   | Build Context Used | |\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-|\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-|\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-| | my\-repo.git                    | refs/heads/master    | /                  | | my\-repo.git\#mytag              | refs/tags/my\-tag     | /                  | | my\-repo.git\#mybranch           | refs/heads/my\-branch | /                  | | my\-repo.git\#pull/42/head       | refs/pull/42/head    | /                  | | my\-repo.git\#:directory         | refs/heads/master    | /directory         | | my\-repo.git\#master:directory   | refs/heads/master    | /directory         | | my\-repo.git\#mytag:directory    | refs/tags/my\-tag     | /directory         | | my\-repo.git\#mybranch:directory | refs/heads/my\-branch | /directory         |

## func IsURL

```go
func IsURL(str string) bool
```

IsURL returns true if the provided str is an HTTP\(S\) URL by checking if it has a http:// or https:// scheme. No validation is performed to verify if the URL is well\-formed.
