# service-level-indicator-exporter-for-kafka

## Overview
Kafka monitoring is a service written in golang who will help you to monitoring and calculate your SLO over your kafka cluster. The service will start a kafka producer who sends fake data to your kafka cluster, collecting the result in different prometheus metrics. Using this metrics you can create different alerts or dashboards.

## Getting Started
### Start the kafka environ
The repo provide a makefile with some useful instruccion. You can start a kafka cluster with zookeeper using the docker-compose file in this project. This will deploy a simple local cluster in which you can test your service.
```bash
    make start-environ
```
### Run kafka monitoring instance
Once you have the kafka cluster up and running you can start your kafka-monitoring instance and take a look on the metrics.
```bash
    make run-producer
```
Nevertheless, you can build the service and run the binary. Next command will generate a binary in `bin/vdp-kafka-monitoring` who you can run locally.
```bash
    make run-binary
```

## Prometheus Metrics Overview

|  Value | Type | Labels | Description |
| -------- | ------ | -------- | -------- |
| kafka_monitoring_cluster_up | Gauge | Cluster | Kafka cluster with error connection. 1 if cluster is up, 0 if cluster is down |
| kafka_monitoring_total_messages_send | Counter | Cluster, Topic | Total messages send by the kafka monitoring services |
| kafka_monitoring_total_messages_read | Counter | Cluster, Topic | Total messages read by the kafka monitoring services |
| kafka_monitoring_error_total_messages_send | Counter | Cluster, Topic | Total messages with errors send by the kafka monitoring services |
| kafka_monitoring_message_send_duration | Summary | Cluster, Topic | Latency for kafka producer message send |

##Â Example dashboards

We provide couple of dashboard as an example for the main monitoring system like grafana or wavefront.

Inside the resources folder you will find an [grafana example dashboard](resources/grafana-dashboard.json).
