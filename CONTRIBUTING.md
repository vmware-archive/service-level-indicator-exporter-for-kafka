# Contributing to VMware Deployment Platform (VDP) - #innersource

VDP is internal service provider available to VMware teams to serve as a platform for deploying production VMware SaaS
applications. With a growing list of teams leveraging VDP, inner sourcing will become increasingly more important in
reducing duplicate services. With VDP's position as an internal platform it is important not only for the VDP teams
growth but also for providing a platform that other teams can leverage innersourcing on top of VDP.

Aligning with an inner sourcing model that allows other teams to contribute to applications developed and/or maintained
by VDP. This page serves as a guide for developers both inside and outside the VDP team to contribute to VDPs
codebase.
